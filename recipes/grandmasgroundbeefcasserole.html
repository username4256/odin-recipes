        <h1>Grandma's Ground Beef Casserole</h1>

        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            My grandmother's old-fashioned hamburger casserole is comfort food at its best! 
            Featuring ground beef, noodles, and a creamy cheese sauce, this simple recipe dates 
            back to the 1940's. I've tweaked the amount of cheese and sour cream depending on 
            what I've got in the fridge and it always turns out great! My mother has suggested 
            this was made up as a way to use up ingredients in the fridge.
